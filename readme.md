This is a project just for fun.
I want to create a simple graphical simulator that shows the orbits of the earth and other astronomical bodies around the sun.
My goals are to:
    --> Create  planets that posess real world values for mass, speed, etc.
    --> Have the planets orbit around the sun concurrently
    --> Accurately define gravity in the simulation for the planets and the sun
    --> Possibly add other stars or asteroids to the simulation
